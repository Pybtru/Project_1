Python project in which we perform the union and transformation of several .csv files through the use of pandas. 
We create and store data in a temporary database. 
The ultimate goal is to reach conclusions such as "which sports make you burn the most calories", "what types of training are the most popular", etc., which are finally visualized in graphs.
